# pyqgis-standalone
Standalone PyQGIS application that is able to run a custom script, in this case Proximity.py without the need of a GUI. Also we don't need to set all kinds of environment variables using a batch file: just launch the VS Code project, and off you go.

# Credits
This is based on work by @isogeo: https://github.com/isogeo/isogeo-plugin-qgis/blob/master/.vscode/settings.json as well as various posts on the QGIS stackexchange forum and in particular Kadir Åžahbaz: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/421329/pyqgis-outside-gui-module-qgis-processing-has-no-attribute-run

# Wishful thinking
It would be great if the QGIS team at one point in the future, would make this process seamless :)
